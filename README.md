# ETH-BTCINFO

Welcome everyone, 

This is my second project which really amazing. Here is our goals:

1- We will be using python libraray web application called streamlit
2- We will build data science web app 
3- We will be using crypto assets data 
4- Getting accurate information from original source
5- Getting info from original source will help us identify our design process in data analysis once we started analysing

Skills used:

1-Streamlit 
2-Python 

Resuources used:

1-youtube.com
2-towardsdatascience.com

Notes:
1- This is indivisiual contribution.
2- I built the entire project.
3- This is one my personal projects to boost my skills in data analysis and data science in general 

Completion Date: 19 Septempeter 2022
